# Independent Study Module (ISM): Applied Cryptography

The objective of the ISM was to study, implement, and test the secutity vulnerabilities found in email clients who support two major email end-to-end encryption: OpenPGP and S/MIME.

We followed a paper recently published on the same topic. The paper outlined the attacks that can be carried out on the the email clients supporting S/MIME and OpenPGP.
